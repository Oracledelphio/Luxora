# LUXORA

## Overview
Luxora is an e-commerce platform built using **Next.js, Django, GraphQL (Strawberry), and Chokidar**. The platform supports user authentication, product management, and a shopping cart.

- **Testing**: The application is tested using **Vitest, Cypress, and Djangoâ€™s Unittest framework**.
